---Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.

CREATE TABLE twitter 
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    date TEXT,
    twit TEXT,
    image TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO twitter (date, twit, image) VALUES ("1-1-2022", "Hello world!", "image.jpeg");
INSERT INTO twitter (date, twit, image) VALUES ("2-1-2022", "How are you world?", "image2.jpeg");
INSERT INTO twitter (date, twit, image) VALUES ("3-1-2022", "I don't hear you world!", "NaN");
INSERT INTO twitter (date, twit, image) VALUES ("4-1-2022", "Oh fine :/", "image3.jpeg");

SELECT * FROM  twitter;

UPDATE twitter SET image = "image4.png" WHERE id = "1";
UPDATE twitter SET date = "2-1-2022" WHERE id = "3";

SELECT * FROM  twitter;  

DELETE FROM twitter WHERE date = "2-1-2022";

SELECT * FROM  twitter;
